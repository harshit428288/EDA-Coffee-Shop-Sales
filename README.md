# Exploratory Data Analysis of Coffee Shop Sales 

This repository contains the Python code and analysis conducted to explore and understand the sales data of a coffee shop. 

## Project Objectives

The following objectives were addressed in this exploratory data analysis:

1.  **Revenue Analysis:**
    * **Determine the total revenue generated by each store location over a specific period.**
    * **Compare the sales performance of different store locations.**
    * **Determine the average transaction value for each store.**

2.  **Product Performance:**
    * **Identify the top-selling products in each store location.**

3.  **Sales Trends:**
    * **Identify the peak sales hours and days of the week.**

4.  **Customer Behavior:**
    * **Analyze the purchasing patterns of customers over time.**
    * **Determine the average number of items purchased per transaction.**

5.  **Predictive Analysis (Optional):**
    * **Predict future demand for specific products based on historical sales data.** (If applicable)

## Dataset

The dataset, `Coffee Shop Sales.xlsx` (or `.csv`), contains transaction-level sales data for a coffee shop, with the following columns:

* `transaction_id`: Unique transaction identifier.
* `transaction_date`: Date of the transaction.
* `transaction_time`: Time of the transaction.
* `transaction_day`: Day of the week.
* `store_id`: Store location ID.
* `store_location`: Name of the store location.
* `product_id`: Product ID.
* `unit_price`: Price per unit.
* `product_category`: General product category (e.g., Coffee, Bakery).
* `product_type`: Specific product type (e.g., Brewed Coffee, Scone).
* `product_detail`: Detailed product description.

## Tools and Libraries Used

* `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
* `numpy`: For numerical computations.
* `matplotlib`: For creating visualizations.
* `seaborn`: For advanced statistical visualizations.

## Project Structure

* `INT375 CA2.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the EDA code and analysis.
* `Coffee Shop Sales.xlsx` (or `.csv`): Dataset file.
